    "description": "Volunteers from the Santa Monica Community Gardens discuss how to attract hummingbirds, bees, and butterflies to your gardens, followed by hands-on activities with their California Climate Action Corps Fellows. Fellows will discuss species selection, planting and maintenance of a variety of native species.  Whether you are interested in butterflies, bees or hummingbirds, small spaces can be magical spaces with just a few small changes. Help us as we look to increase Pollinator Habitat throughout Santa Monica.  An Emerald Necklace connecting communities will help all of our gardens grow. A partnership of the Santa Monica Public Library, Office of Sustainability and the Environment and the California Climate Action Corps."
